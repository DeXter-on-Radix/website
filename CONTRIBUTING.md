Contributions are welcome!

Check out [existing issues (especially Todo)](https://github.com/orgs/DeXter-on-Radix/projects/1/views/1), review a [pull request](https://github.com/orgs/DeXter-on-Radix/projects/1/views/3), or [create a new issue](https://github.com/DeXter-on-Radix/website/issues/new) to start a discussion.

Here are a few guidelines to follow:

- **Discuss** major changes with the maintainers before starting work, our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Y44jqe2q2W) is a good place to do that
- **Use [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)** - commits direclty to `main` branch are not allowed
- **Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** and automatic code formatting to keep PRs focused on the changes
- **Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** to keep code clean and consistent
- **Make PRs small and focused on a single change** so they are easier to review and merge
- **Make PRs complete** so that the new feature is functional
- **Write tests** to prevent regressions, unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in `__tests__` folder, end to end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) in `e2e` folder

If you happen to use VS Code, install the recommended extensions to get automatic formatting and linting on save, they are listed in `.vscode/extensions.json` and VS Code will prompt you to install them.

In order to contribute, you need to set up the development envirment. 
Use the following set up section for instructions.


## Set Up

- Fork the Dexter repository to your github account.
- Clone from your forked repo.
- Make a new branch with a feature name (you can see some example in [closed PRs](https://github.com/DeXter-on-Radix/website/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)).
- Make some changes.
- Commit and push local branch changes to your own repo.
- Make a pull request into the [original Dexter repo](https://github.com/DeXter-on-Radix/website).

Now you are ready to run the project locally.(instructions to be found in README.md ).
