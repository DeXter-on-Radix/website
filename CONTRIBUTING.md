Contributions are welcome! Check out [good first issues](https://github.com/DeXter-on-Radix/website/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open) or create a new issue to start a discussion.

Here are a few guidelines to follow:

- **Discuss** major changes with the maintainers before starting work, our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ybydr5NT) is a good place to do that
- **Use [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)** - commits direclty to `main` branch are not allowed
- **Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** and automatic code formatting to keep PRs focused on the changes
- **Make PRs small and focused on a single change** so they are easier to review and merge
- **Make PRs complete** so that the new feature is functional
- **Write tests** to prevent regressions
