Contributions are welcome! Check out [good first issues](https://github.com/DeXter-on-Radix/website/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open) or create a new one to start a discussion.

Here are a few guidelines to follow:

- **[Use Prittier](https://prettier.io/)** and automatic code formatting to keep PRs focused on the changes
- **Make PRs small and focused on a single change** so they are easier to review and merge
- **Make PRs complete** so that the new feature is functional
- **Write tests** to prevent regressions
