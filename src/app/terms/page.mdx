# Terms of Service

Last updated: August 29, 2023

## Introduction

Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully. By accessing or using the DeXter digital asset platform (“Site”) or any other related services offered by DeXter (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to be bound by this agreement. This Agreement is between you and DeXter, including its subsidiaries and affiliates (“DeXter”, “we”, “our”, “us”).

This Agreement incorporates any additional terms and conditions posted by DeXter to the Site, or otherwise made available to you, including during interactions with certain digital assets and our online/mobile services.

If you access or use the Site on behalf of an entity (“Organization”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity. In such cases, "you" refers to both the individual and the Organization.

**IMPORTANT:** This Agreement includes a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver. Review it thoroughly. Persons from restricted jurisdictions are not permitted to use the Services.

## Description of Services

DeXter offers a platform for trading digital assets on the Radix network. Users deposit their assets into the AlphaDEX smart contract and authorize transactions via the Site.

Our Services focus solely on asset exchanges within the Radix network. We do not support fiat to digital asset conversions, or the inverse.

**A platform fee ranging from 0.0% to 0.1% is applied to every transaction, whether Market or Limit. Users will also encounter Radix network fees, which are transparently displayed before executing any order.**

DeXter operates non-custodially; we don't own or control user assets. Users maintain full ownership at all times.

## General Information

By using the Services, you confirm you've read, understood, and accepted these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If accessing the Services on behalf of an entity, you attest to having the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

DeXter does not suspend access to the Services. However, we reserve the right to block or prevent specific wallet addresses from connecting to our Site due to legal demands, regulatory concerns, or violations of this Agreement.

## Security of your Account and Wallet

DeXter isn't an insured financial institution. Your digital assets accessed through our Services aren't insured against loss.

As a non-custodial platform, we don't have access to the private keys of your Wallets. Your Wallet’s security and confidentiality are your responsibility. Any failure to adequately secure your Wallet could lead to losses for which DeXter cannot be held liable.

## Trading Terms

DeXter’s platform connects user orders with those of other users. Depending on the trading activity, orders might be partially filled or filled by multiple other orders. Transactions can fail for reasons like price changes, order availability, or technical issues. We cannot guarantee that a transaction will be executed, and we aren't liable for transaction failures or delays, including issues dispatching to the Radix Network.

The availability and prices of digital assets can be volatile. We might also delist an asset from DeXter without prior notice. Though we strive for continuous availability and accurate pricing data, we can't guarantee consistent service. Any risks or losses from delisting, price changes, or pricing discrepancies are assumed by you.

Note: Our primary role is as a platform provider; we typically don't act as the main participant or counterpart in trades. However, our affiliates or partners might execute trades on the platform.

## Prohibited Activity

In using our Site and Services, you mustn't:

- Breach any laws or regulations or assist others in doing so.

To the extent allowed by law, all warranties, implied or explicit, are disclaimed.
